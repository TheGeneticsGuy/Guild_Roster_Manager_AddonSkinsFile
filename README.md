**Important information:**

* As I do not use ElvUI myself, I will need to be informed if there are ever any bugs. I think it is a wonderful project that the devs have put together, and it is incredibly popular, so I have wanted to support it. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF IT STOPS WORKING OR IF IT BUGS OUT!

* Use [This Discord Link to reach me quickly](https://discord.gg/wA7bPUfZuK), and join in the overall Community for discussion with many other guild leaders!
