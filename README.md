# Guild_Roster_Manager_AddonSkinsFile
This is the Skinning file for the popular AddOnSkins addon in conjunction with ElvUI interface for World of Warcraft

***THIS SKIN IS INDEPENDENTLY MAINTAINED BY the GUILD ROSTER MANAGER CREATOR***

If the author of *AddOnSkins* does not merge my file when I send, you can always download them and install manually at this location. Just save over the one already there:

```\Interface\AddOns\AddOnSkins\Skins\AddOns\Guild_Roster_Manager.lua```

**Important information:**

* As I do not use ElvUI myself, I will need to be informed if there are ever any bugs. I think it is a wonderful project that the devs have put together, and it is incredibly popular, so I have wanted to support it. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF IT STOPS WORKING OR IF IT BUGS OUT!
